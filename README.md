# Personal Doctor
This is a personal doctor system that predicts the disease you might have give the symptoms that you are facing.

The excel files are used as a database. They contain the information regarding a disease and all its corresponding symptoms. 
The user is prompted to keep entering the issues that they are facing, example 'cough', 'cold', 'fever', 'inflammation' etc until the software can
zero down to 3 or less possible diseases that match your symptoms to the highest degree.

The motivation for the project is to educate a patient towards the first step in identifying the cause of their discomfort. This will also help them
make informed choices when they decide to visit a doctor.

The [rogram is written in python3 and tkinter is used for the GUI of the project.
